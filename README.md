# AirGarage Coding Assignment

# How to view:
## Recommended:

I have deployed the site to my domain [here](https://airgarage.justinthurman.dev/).

## Alternatively:

Deploy the site locally. Instructions below.

## Preparation

You must set the `REACT_APP_YELP_API_KEY` environment variable to your Yelp API key in order to use.

You will also need to set your own CORS proxy. For security reasons, I cannot make my CORS proxy public.
To use a CORS proxy, set the `REACT_APP_CORS_PROXY_URL` environment variable to the URL of your proxy.
You must include the full URL, beginning with `https` and including the trailing `/`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
